# Kirby's Dream Land autosplitter for BizHawk

This autosplitter will automatically start when you press Start on the main menu. Then, it will split upon boss death
on the stages bosses, not during the boss rush. Finally, it will finish on the last hit on Dedede.

This has been tested on normal mode, but it should work on extra mode.

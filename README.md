# Aria-Speedrun-Scripts
Script files for learning about games to run them faster.
All scripts so far are used in BizHawk.

Feel free to use and modify the code for your own game exploring!

# Jurassic Park (SNES)
Most of these files were single-use tests I came up with to learn about the game. They may be useful if you want to explore that aspect of the game, or you might find code snippets from them useful. There are examples of reading/writing memory, reading/sending game input, saving/loading a lua table from a file, etc.

# Kirby's Dream Land (GB)
This is an autosplitter for use with BizHawk. Will automatically start when the Start button is pressed on the main menu. After, it will split after the first 4 stage bosses, but not during the boss rush. Finally, it will split on the final hit on Dedede.
